- **Kha Van** - Community Leader Amazon Web Services


### Key Highlights

#### 1. Deep Dive: Amazon Bedrock Agents
The session began with an in-depth analysis of **Amazon Bedrock Agents**, marking the shift from passive LLM usage to proactive AI Agents.

* **Core Concepts:** Agents go beyond answering queries; they possess planning capabilities and can utilize tools to achieve objectives.
* **Architecture:**
    * Connects Foundation Models (FMs) with enterprise data sources and APIs.
    * Utilizes "Chain-of-Thought" reasoning to decompose complex user requests into executable steps.
* **Key Features:**
    * Memory management to maintain conversational context.
    * Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
    * Tracing capabilities to monitor agent reasoning for debugging and optimization.

#### 4. Advanced Technical Session (L300): Orchestration & Context Optimization
An advanced technical deep dive (Level 300) exploring the integration of CloudThinker with Amazon Bedrock:

* **Orchestration Framework:**
    * Designing systems for multi-agent collaboration.
    * Intelligent routing logic to direct tasks to the appropriate specialized Agent.
* **Context Optimization:**
    * Techniques for managing LLM Context Windows on Bedrock.
    * Strategies for selecting critical information for prompts to reduce token costs and improve response accuracy.
