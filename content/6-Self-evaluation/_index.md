During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **07/09** to **28/11**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I gained in school to real-world cloud environments.

I participated in building a chatbot system using AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, RDS PostgreSQL, Amazon Bedrock, Cohere Embeddings, and VPC networking components. Through this project, I improved my skills in cloud architecture design, programming, system analysis, technical documentation, teamwork, and communication.

Regarding work ethic, I always strived to complete assigned tasks on time, follow team workflows, and proactively communicate with my mentor to ensure effective collaboration.

Below is my self-evaluation based on key performance criteria:
